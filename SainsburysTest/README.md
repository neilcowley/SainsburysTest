Sainsburys Test
=================================================

The Project uses Maven for the following dependencies:

	- jSoup
	- gson
	- jUnit
	
In order to run the test please open the 'testsrc' folder, 'com.sainsburys' package, locate and right click on 'ScrapeDataTest.java' - Run As - jUnit Test

To run the console application please open the 'src' folder, 'com.sainsburys' package, locate the 'RunExample.java' file - Run As - Java Application

Given the time constraints I hope I have been able to achieve the main part of the task and believe it could be extended into some kind of Restful API that would allow you to enter a URL and return the products for any given page.

Thank you
